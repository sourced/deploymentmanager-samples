# Example of the Interconnect Attachment template usage.
#
# This example has two resources listed but you should only be creating one at a time either a dedicated
# or partner interconnect so remove the one that you are not creating.
#
# Replace the following with appropriate values
# <FIXME:name>: replace with the name of the attachment
# <FIXME:router>: replace with the url of the cloud router.
# <FIXME:region>: replace with the region that the cloud router is in.
# <FIXME:interconnect>: DEDICATED Circuits only replace with the url of the interconnect
# <FIXME:edgeAvailabilityDomain>: PARTNER Inertonnects only replace with the edge availibility domain 
# Refer to https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/interconnectAttachments for more details
