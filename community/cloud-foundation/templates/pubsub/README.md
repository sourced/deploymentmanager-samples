git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/deploymentmanager-samples
cd community/cloud-foundation
cp templates/pubsub/examples/pubsub.yaml my_pubsub.yaml
vim my_pubsub.yaml  # <== change values to match your GCP setup
gcloud deployment-manager deployments create <YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_NAME> \
    --config my_pubsub.yaml
```

#### Create

``` bash
gcloud deployment-manager deployments create <YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_NAME> \
