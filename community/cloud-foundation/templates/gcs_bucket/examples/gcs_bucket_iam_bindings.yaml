# Example on how to use the cloud storage bucket template
#
# In this example, a storage bucket is created in location us-east1
# with name test-bucket. Cloud storage bucket names should be unique globally
# refer https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/naming for bucket and object 
# naming guidelines. To ensure bucket name is unique you may chose to 
# set the `autoGenerateName` property to True - this will append a 10
# digit random alphanumeric string to the `name` like {name}-{randomstring}
#
# IAM Policies are also applied with the `bindings` section
# Replace the following with appropirate values
# {user_account_email_address} : A valid user account
# {service_account_email_address}: A valid service account email address
# Refer to https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/buckets for more details
