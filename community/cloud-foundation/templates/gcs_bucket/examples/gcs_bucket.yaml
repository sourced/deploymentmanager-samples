# Example on how to use the cloud storage bucket template
#
# In this example, a storage bucket is created in location us-east1
# with name test-bucket. Cloud storage bucket names should be unique globally
# refer https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/naming for bucket and object 
# naming guidelines. To ensure bucket name is unique you may chose to 
# set the `autoGenerateName` property to True - this will append a 10
# digit random alphanumeric string to the `name` like {name}-{randomstring}
#
# IAM Policies can be applied during bucket creation should you choose to 
# apply them, add `bindings` section under properties
# Please refer to `templates/gcs_bucket.py.schema` for more details
