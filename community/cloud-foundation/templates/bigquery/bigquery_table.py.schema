  description: |
    Deploys a BigQuery Table.

    For more information on this resource:

imports:
  - path: bigquery_table.py

required:
  - name

properties:
  name:
    type: string
    description: The name of the resource.
  datasetId:
    type: string
    description: |
      The ID of the dataset this table belongs to.
  friendlyName:
    type: string
    description: A descriptive name for this table.
  expirationTime:
    type: string
    description: |
      The time when this table expires, in milliseconds since the epoch. If
      not present, the table will persist indefinitely. Expired tables will
      be deleted and their storage reclaimed. The defaultTableExpirationMs
      property of the encapsulating dataset can be used to set a default
      expirationTime on newly created tables. Example, 1535739430
  timePartitioning:
    type: object
    description: Time-based partitioning specification for this table.
    properties:
      expirationMs:
        type: string
        format: int64
        description: |
          Number of milliseconds for which to keep the storage for partitions
          in the table. The storage in a partition will have an expiration
          time of its partition time plus this value.
      field:
        type: string
        description: |
          If not set, the table is partitioned by pseudo column, referenced
          via either '_PARTITIONTIME' as TIMESTAMP type, or '_PARTITIONDATE'
          as DATE type. If field is specified, the table is instead partitioned
          by this field. The field must be a top-level TIMESTAMP or DATE field.
          Its mode must be NULLABLE or REQUIRED.
      requirePartitionFilter:
        type: boolean
        description: |
          If set to true, queries over this table require a partition filter
          that can be used for partition elimination to be specified.
      type:
        type: string
        description: |
          The only type supported is DAY, which will generate one partition
          per day.
  view:
    type: object
    description: The view definintion.
    properties:
      query:
        type: string
        description: |
          A query that BigQuery executes when the view is referenced.
      useLegacySql:
        type: boolean
        description: |
          Specifies whether to use BigQuery's legacy SQL for this view. The
          default value is true. If set to false, the view will use BigQuery's
          standard SQL: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/sql-reference/
          Queries and views that reference this view must use the same flag
          value.

                An inline resource that contains code for a user-defined
                function (UDF). Providing a inline code resource is
                equivalent to providing a URI for a file containing the same
                code.

  schema:
    type: array
