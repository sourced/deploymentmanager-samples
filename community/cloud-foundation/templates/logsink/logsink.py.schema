  title: Logging Sink
  author: Sourced Group Inc.

    Creates a logging sink to export entries to a desired destination.

required:
  - destinationType
  - destinationName

properties:
  name:
    type: string
    description: Name of the sink resource.
  destinationName:
    type: string
    description: |
      An identifier of the destination resource, such as: a name for a Bucket,
      a topic ID for a PubSub, or a dataset ID for a BigQuery. The IDs must
      contain only letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), or underscores (_).
      The maximum ID length is 1,024 characters.
  destinationType:
    type: string
    description: The type of the destination resource.
    enum:
      - pubsub
      - storage
      - bigquery
  uniqueWriterIdentity:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Determines the kind of the IAM identity returned as writerIdentity for the
      new sink. If "true", the sink is owned by a non-project resource such
      as an organization. In this case, the writerIdentity value is a unique
      serivce account used only for exports from the new sink.
    default: true
  filter:
    type: string
    description: |
      An advanced log filter that limits the export to those log entries that: (a) 
      are in the resource that owns the sink; and (b) matches the filter condition(s).

outputs:
  properties:
    - writerIdentity:
      type: string
      description: |
        A service account which Logging writes the exported logentries to the
        sink's destination. Until you grant this identity write-access to the
        destination, log entry exports from this sink will fail.
