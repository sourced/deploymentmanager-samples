          to this service account for the subnet specified by the
          `sharedVPCSubnets.subnetId` field.
          This field should not be set if `sharedVPCHost` is set to True.
  concurrentApiActivation:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      Boolean flag if set to True activates all the requested APIs
      concurrently. When set to False, the apis are activated serially.
      Concurrent activation makes for faster deployment but could potentially
      fail the deployment exceeding the quota limits, make sure to request for
      adequate quota before using this option. Serial activation tends to be a
      lot slower.
