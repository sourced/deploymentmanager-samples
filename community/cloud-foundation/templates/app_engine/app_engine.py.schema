imports:
  - path: app_engine.py

properties:
  locationId:
    type: string
    default: us-central
    description: |
      The location from which the application runs. Application instances run
      out of the data centers in the specified location, which is also where
      all of the application's end user content is stored. Supported locations
      can be found here:
      https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/locations.
  authDomain:
    type: string

      access the application. Defaults to open access for any Google Account.

    enum:
      - UNSPECIFIED
      - SERVING

    properties:
      splitHealthChecks:
        type: boolean
        description: |
          Defines whether split healthchecks should be used instead of the
          legacy healthchecks. At the app.yaml level, this means defaulting to
          the 'readinessCheck' and 'livenessCheck' values instead of the
          'healthCheck' ones. Once the legacy 'healthCheck' behavior is
          deprecated, and this value becomes always True, this setting can be
          removed.
