# Example of the VPN template usage.
#
# In this example, a VPN is created.
#
# Upon successful deployment of the VPN resource, the following resources
# are created:
#   - a target VPN gateway (compute.v1.targetVpnGateway)
#   - a static address (compute.v1.address)
#   - an ESP forwarding rule (compute.v1.forwardingRule)
#   - a UDP 4500 forwarding rule (compute.v1.forwardingRule)
#   - a UDP 500 forwarding rule (compute.v1.forwardingRule)
#   - a VPN tunnel (compute.v1.vpnTunnel)
