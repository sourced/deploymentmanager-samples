# Cloud Foundation Toolkit Project and Repository

## Overview

The Cloud Foundation toolkit (henceforth, CFT) includes the following parts:

- A comprehensive set of production-ready resource templates that follow
  Google's best practices, which can be used with the CFT or the gcloud
  utility (part of the Google Cloud SDK) - see Template Developer Guide(../docs/template_dev_guide.md)
- A command-line interface (henceforth, CLI) that deploys resources defined in
  single or multiple CFT-compliant config files - see the
  [CFT User Guide](../docs/userguide.md)
- A sample pipeline that enables running CFT deployment operations from
  Jenkins - see the [pipeline documentation](../pipeline/README.md)
