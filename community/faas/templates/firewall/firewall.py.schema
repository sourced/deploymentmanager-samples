  description: Deploys firewall rules

required:
  - rules

properties:
  network:
    type: string
    description: |
      The network name. Defaults to 'global/networks/default'
  rules:
    type: array
    description: |
      An array of firewall rules as defined in the documentation:
      https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/beta/firewalls

      If the 'priority' field is specified in the rule, it's always used as is.
      If the 'priority' field for the rule is not set, the template will set
      the priority to the same value as index of the rule in the array +1000.
      For example, if not set in rule, priority for the first rule in the array
      is '1000', for the second rule '1001', and so on. What this means is that
      if the 'priority' field isn't specified in any of the rules in the array,
      the ruleset will be automatically sorted by priority, so consistency when
      specifying (or not specifying) the 'priority' field is strongly advised.

      Example:
        - name: allow-proxy-from-inside
          allowed:
            - IPProtocol: tcp
              ports:
                - "80"
                - "443"
          description: This rule allows connectivity to the HTTP proxies
          direction: INGRESS
          sourceRanges:
            - 10.0.0.0/8
        - name: allow-dns-from-inside
          allowed:
            - IPProtocol: udp
              ports:
                - "53"
            - IPProtocol: tcp
              ports:
                - "53"
          description: this rule allows DNS queries to google's 8.8.8.8
          direction: EGRESS
          destinationRanges:
            - 8.8.8.8/32
