# Example on how to use the vpn template
#
# In this example, a vpn is created.
#
# Upon successfully deploying the vpn resource, the following resources
# are created:
#   - a Target VPN Gateway (compute.v1.targetVpnGateway)
#   - a static address (compute.v1.address)
#   - ESP forwarding rule (compute.v1.forwardingRule)
#   - UDP 4500 forwarding rule (compute.v1.forwardingRule)
#   - UDP 500 forwarding rule (compute.v1.forwardingRule)
#   - a VPN Tunnel (compute.v1.vpnTunnel)
